# My-calculator
##### My project is about using a simple calculator to easen your work when doing the math. It's not a complicated calculator and hence can be used by anyone who knows how to count numbers. It's first very accurate and reliable at any time.
Some of the main things:

1. I created a rough work on how my calculator would look like using the balsamiq website
2. I used net beans in creating a calculator and the language is java.

##### Find some of the attached photos of what I started and what it ended up looking like.
